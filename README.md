# GiphyAPI

1. The GiphyAPI app will load 10 gifs from hte giphy api for any given topic the user enters in the text box. A few topics have been chosen and will always be loaded first before any user input choices. Each gif will be loaded as a still image and, when clicked, will animate and then stop again if clicked again. Below each gif the gif's title, rating, and link to the gifs gihpyAPI page will be included. See comments in the app.js to see how the app works.
